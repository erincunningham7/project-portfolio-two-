## General Information

This is a challenging quiz that tests the clients pop culture knowledge. When deciding a concept for this project, I decided to create a quiz that incorporates a topic that I am familiar with. This made it easy for me to create questions and answers that I didn't have to spend time researching.

The website contains all of the classic elements of a quiz - a series of multiple choice answers, a timer, and a user score that displays once all of the questions have been answered.
